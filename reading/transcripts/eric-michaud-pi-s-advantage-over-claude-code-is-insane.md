In this video, we're taking our very first steps toward true independence from bloated platforms like Claude Code, and OpenClaw by building out our own custom AI agent using Pi. Pi is a minimalist, highly-customizable agent harness that gives you the keys to your workflow without the unnecessary product overhead.
I’ll show you exactly what Pi is, why its lean setup (using just read, write, edit, and bash tools) is the perfect foundation, and how to get it installed live. We’ll connect our OpenRouter API keys, hook into Codex, and watch Pi seamlessly convert 39 of my custom Obsidian workflow prompts into native Pi slash commands. If you're tired of paying token costs for integrations you never use and want a custom solution that runs exactly how you work—with zero training wheels—let's dig in. (Disclaimer: Pi runs in full YOLO mode with unrestricted file system access, so buckle up!)

## Transcript

In this video, we're going to be taking our very first steps towards independence from platforms like Claude Code, Anti-Gravity, and the like by building out our own custom agent in Pi.

I'm going to tell you exactly what Pi is, why it's worth consideration, and how to get it set up. This is less a tutorial because I haven't done it yet myself. We're going to be doing that together. More about why this is so important and why it goes along with what we've been talking about on the channel for a little while. Let's dig in. Okay, so here we are on pi.dev and I think the most important place to start would be what the heck is Pi? And Pi is an agent harness, right? Much like Claude Code or Codex or whatever, but this is more like a toolkit for agent integrations. This is actually powering some of the most popular projects on the planet right now, most notably Open Claw. The entire Open Claw ecosystem and all that stuff is built on top of Pi.

So, very much unlike Claude Code and Open Claw, Pi is designed to be minimal.

The idea being that you can customize this to match your use case specifically, rather than all the extra you would get from downloading Open Claw or Claude Code. You get just what you need and nothing else. And it's tailored specifically for the way that you work with AI agents. So much so that out of the box, they only have four tools: read, write, edit, and bash. So, it can read the contents of a file, it can write file contents, it can edit or replace exact text in a file, and it can run bash commands in a terminal. Cuz they figure, as it turns out, that's really all you need for an effective coding agent. So, why build more tools on top of that if you don't actually need them. Any of the models you bring in already know how to use bash. They've also been trained on read, write, and edit tools with the same sort of input schemas. And they're arguing, you compare this to Claude Code's tool definitions, and it's just all unnecessary bloat. The amazing part about this is Pi's system prompt and tool definitions for a working coding assistant together are below 1,000 tokens. Compared to Claude Code or Open Claw's sometimes 12 to 16,000 input tokens, this is incredibly efficient, which is perk number one. While this is super great for efficiency and keeping things absolutely to their leanest, there are a few things that you may take for granted from more off-the-shelf harnesses like Claude Code. The idea is that it's extensible. They give you the chassis and you just put in the pieces that you want. So, out of the box, no MCP, but again, extensible. No sub agents, no plan mode, no built-in to-do's, no background bash. All that stuff you can add with extensions or skills or build out your own sort of integrations like that. But the one I do want to talk about is no permissions.

This is always running in like the go dangerously or yellow mode, whatever you want to call it. It's yellow by default.

So, Pi runs in full-on admin, so it doesn't, you know how when you're running in Claude Code, you have to click yes if like you want to edit a file, you have to give it permissions.

This doesn't do that. So, I guess this is kind of a disclaimer because there's a lot of folks that used Open Claw in the early days and they put themselves in a wreck because of this specific feature. It has unrestricted access to your file system and can execute any command without permission checks or safety rails. No permission prompts, no pre-checking of bash commands for malicious content, full file system access access and can execute any command with your user privileges. So, it's seriously like you sitting down at the desk doing things yourself. The good thing here though is, unlike Open Claw that had all of these pre-built connections and a lot of different bloat and instructions, this is specifically what you tell it to do. So, at least you know exactly what its capabilities are because you're building it from the ground up. That said, I'm comfortable moving forward with Pi, but even in their own documentation, it says, "If you're uncomfortable with full access, run Pi inside a container or don't bother." Anyway, that's the disclaimer side of things out of the way. Okay-dokey, so that answers the first question, what the heck is Pi? It's a agent toolkit that gives you the keys, right? And that leads directly into why would you consider Pi instead of something like Open Claw or Claude Code that's already built out? So, like we alluded to before, all of those other like pre-built packages, like the Claude Codes of the world, Open Claw in particular, comes with a massive product overhead. Not just in system prompts and tools and stuff, but there's a lot of connections here that you absolutely don't need, but you're still paying for in terms of token and compute. Like, check it out. Okay, so you got like WhatsApp, Telegram. You got all these different things. It says like 50 plus integrations, right? How many of us use all of these? But we're still paying for every single one. Like I was saying, same thing with Claude Code. There's a lot of different tool definitions and all sorts of stuff that you might never actually use, but they're still part of your agent. This is the raw toolkit that you can build out absolutely anything you want tailored to work the way that you want. Just like Peter Steinberger did with Open Claw, you can start with Pi and build out absolutely anything you want on top of it to work exactly the way that you need it to. You have absolute full control and transparency.

The git's right here. You can build anything you want on top of it. And I think that is insanely important. The most viewed videos on my channel have a lot to do with how terms of use changes are affecting the average person. And I've got like a couple hundred comments on each of those. I've talked to like a thousand people that have experienced the same frustration where the model isn't working the same as it used to, or they can't even get through a whole week with the same subscription anymore. So, I think it is more important as time goes on to move away from reliance on these larger tech companies and AI providers and just build your own custom solution. Which is what we've been saying on this channel for a little while now. Not just with the Obsidian Vault and all that stuff, but like going back to my days of the AI personal assistants, if you're one of the OGs, you'll know that I was against Open Claw because you're taking someone else's personal agent and applying it to your use case, which probably doesn't match up, right? You want to make sure that you have the keys. They're yours. Okay, so we got what is Pi, we got why is Pi, let's do how is Pi? So, it's just So, it's the same as you would with any of these other little packages. We're going to go to bash and just copy that. npm install. Here we go.

Okay, so I'm going to go check the version now just to make sure that it's installed. All right, so Pi's installed.

I got ham fingers and I uh &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; gave it an error. I'm going to move this down here. I'm going to go like this so you can see. Okay, so it downloaded a bunch of different dependencies and stuff that it needed. Read the blog post. Fantastic. I'm in here. It says auto 400,000 token context. But the question I have is it is saying it's running on GPT-5.1 Codex and I'm curious where it's charging. Like if it's taking my Codex install here and using that. Okay, so the cool thing is it's is it's already found my agents.md, but the question I have is if it's using my Open AI subscription or like how I'm connected at the moment.

So, I'm going to ask just straight away.

We're connected through the Pi coding agent environment you launched from running inside that harness.

Found it. Okay, so it is actually pulling from my Open Router API key automatically in my OS environment variables, which is sick. I'm going to double-check that actually right now. So, that is really interesting. I've got Open Router API key in my environment variables and Pi picked up on that immediately.

Um that's awesome because I don't have to like run that config. Just to catch you up, okay? Because that was kind of cool. Open Router is a service that has access to every AI model all under one API key, right? There's some free ones, there's uh you have access to like Opus 4.6, like literally everything. Very first step, if you want to get this set up just like I did, is go to openrouter.ai and then get an API key. Sign up, go to the main page, and just click get API key. You're going to get your API key and then you're going to put it in your system environment variable like so so that you never ever ever Boop. It'll look like this on Windows.

There's another way to do it with Mac.

It's also very easy. But you never have to have them in a file that could be shared on GitHub. Or let's say you're making YouTube videos and it accidentally sneaks in there and you have to like, you know, rotate your entire Right? So, you go to boop.

You go to create and you type it in. Be like, like and subscribe.

Which would really help me out. If you look at my analytics, it says that only 5% of you guys are actually subscribed to the channel. So, if you take a second right now to like and subscribe the video, that super helps me out. It also gives you an opportunity to see more of the content that I put out like this and you can learn some more. Anyway, so we're going to go create. Boop boop boop. And then I'm going to go and take this key and save it just like I said.

I'm going to delete this for the time being so that nobody steals my Boop. There you go. Okay, so that's how you get your Open Router API keys. I'm probably going to end up using the Pi agent to build the Pi agent. But the cool thing here is that you can you can do that. Essentially, that's uh that's my favorite part. Yeah, so what I'm going to try and do is I'm going to try and log in with my OAuth provider, which is Codex at this point, Anthropic, GPT plus. Browser window should open. Where?

&gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Copy this and go check this out. Oh, okay. So, that worked. I couldn't do through my duckduckgo browser because of probably pop-up blockers or something like that. So lame. I had to use my default web browser, but it um here we are. So, now I'm using my Codex Codex subscription instead of my Open Router, which is sick. But I should be able to

There you go. So, I can use any of these. Okay, that's sweet. It goes through Codex and Open Router. Amazing.

Wow, okay. So, here we are set up.

Bare-bones tools. It's just reading my agents.md. So, it does know how to behave. Now, we really want to get this customized though, right? Let's like build this out to make it like awesome.

I think what I want to do is see how it loads off of a cold start. What are we going with?

Codex.

Open AI Codex GPT-5.4. Okay, let's just see what happens. I'm going to go like this and check if we have anything from GPT-5.4.

Negative. Okay, so this is on my Open AI subscription, which is dope. So, essentially, this is Codex working in Pi. Okay, man. Honestly, this is kind of unreal how the fastest part of this entire thing was the actual install of this agent. So, the nice thing is we can use Pi to help it build out our agent.

We can use Pi to help build Pi. One of the things people are talking about that's really cool with the Pi agent is you'll be able to like reskin it, which you can't do with Claude Code and Codex and whatnot. I'm not sure how that'll work in my Obsidian Vault and like just the extension here. But I'm going to say, "Create a pixel art western theme set up for Pi. I want 16-bit Super Nintendo style graphics. Use your imagination." Bad instructions. But anyway, I want include a slash command to toggle this on and off. Let's just give this a go.

See what we come up with. Off. Exploring Pi themes. I need to create a Pi themed extension.

Building this out. Reading the dot Hey, there you go.

So, logging in to GitHub. Seeing what we can do. While that was going, I'm just going to build out a convention for the slash commands that I already had established, right? Can you build out slash commands for all the workflows in our workflows folder? Copy that path.

Follow the convention used in the Claude commands, though for those only in the workflows directory.

Go. Let's see where we're at. Created.

All right. So, how to use slash western on. Okay. So, slash reload.

Woah. Gross.

Sness western. Sunset bites cactus. I'm not sure what that is, but it did it.

There you go. All right. Delete all things western mode.

Saloon prompts. There you go. Done. I added the missing slash commands and for every created Claude commands content writer.

Now you misunderstood. I need this to work in Pi the way it had in Claude code. For Pi, these needs to be prompt template. It's not commands. I've now built them in prompts.

One prompt template per workflow and 39 workflows.

39 Pi slash commands. Okay, great. All available as workflow name arguments. So, let's go slash reload.

Oh, dude. Check it out. Okay. So, it actually turned all of these into sick project prompts, which are skills.

Okay. So, add captions.

All that stuff. So, let's go slash add captions. Dude. It it Okay. So, it brought in all of my skills as slash commands with Pi. All right. So, the state of affairs right now is I'm going to spend a lot of time building this out and whatever. But as it is, this is one agent hub for my Codex subscription and my open router config with all of my slash commands and hooks and stuff brought into the same place, which is dope. So, I'm going to build this out and take a look at some of the packages that are available. I'm really interested in changing the UI so that I can maybe like dig into sub agents and have like different writing modes and content creation and that kind of thing. But that is a different video.

Like I said, I'm doing this live with you guys. I haven't explored this too too much, but I have an idea what I would like to build out. Kind of loving the idea of cutting back on all the different commands I have to do. I just go Pi and now I've got everything in the one place. I'm going to definitely have more videos on this. If you're interested in the Obsidian vault that we're building out here, I've got a couple videos on it. You can check them out on my channel. Or you can get the whole thing for yourself in my school community. You just go to tools and agents and everything will be built out in there. I'm going to leave this setup prompts for just getting Pi off the ground in like a GitHub gist like I have been in the past. But as I build out this custom harness, I'm going to make sure that that is in here as well. If you made it this far in the video and you're not already part of the school community, I think you're going to be a great fit. It's free to try. We're already almost at a thousand members and everybody in there is super helpful and we're all working towards the same goal of building cool stuff and making some money online. Anyway, thanks for hanging out. Let me know how you're going to use this sort of technology in the comments
